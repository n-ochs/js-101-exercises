// Write a function cipher which is given a string, an offset, and returns the Caesar cipher of the string.

//thoughts: make a for loop to find the index of each character in the string and then somehow replace it with another character

function cipher(someString, caesarString) {
    someString.charAt(0)
}

cipher('test')
